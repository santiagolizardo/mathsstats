# About <strong>{{ site.title }}</strong>

The aim of this website is to share statistical concepts in a way that is easy to understand by all readers and not only statiticians or data scientists.

Each section of the site contains a concept, followed by its definition and one form of example. The example can either by written in mathematical terms or using the **R programming language**. The code for this entire website is available on Github.

I hope you enjoy learning new concepts or refreshing existing ones with us.

For any question or suggestion, please leave a comment below.
