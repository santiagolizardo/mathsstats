A **case-control study** of the association between an exposure *E* and a disease *D* typically includes a group of **cases** with the disease *D* and a group of **controls** without the disease *D*, who are otherwise comparable to the cases. The past exposures of the cases and controls are determined and the occurrences of exposure *E* are identified.
