A study is **biased** if some aspects of the design, sampling, data collection or analysis method produce results that systematically overestimate or underestimate the strenght of association. In particular, bias may arise from **selection bias, information bias** or **confounding**.

## Selection bias

In survey sampling, the bias that results from an unrepresentative sample is called selection bias. Some common examples of selection bias are described below.

## Information bias

Information bias is any systematic difference from the truth that arises in the collection, recall, recording and handling of information in a study, including how missing data is dealt with.

## Confounding

A confounder is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable, causing a spurious association. Confounding is a causal concept, and as such, cannot be described in terms of correlations or associations.
