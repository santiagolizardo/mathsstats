# {{ page.title }}

A multivariate data set comprises observations on two or more random variables. A **bivariate** data set has two variables. The number of variables, *p*, is the **dimension** of the data set. An **observation** is the set of *p* measuraments made on one sampled unit. The variables $$X_1, \ldots, X_p$$ form the columns of the $$n \times p$$ **data matrix X**, where *p* is the number of observations.
